# Welcome to Terabethia

![](imgs/main.png)

Terabethia is a bridge between Ethereum & the Internet Computer  that contracts in both chains can use to message each other, and that Ethereum assets (ERC20, ERC721, & ERC1155) can use to be automatically mirrored & used on the IC.

!!! Important

    This is a Testnet V2 version of Terabethia âœ¨ intended for testing, gathering developer feedback, and auditing as we move forward with the development needed for a mainnet release. Any developer can start building on Terabethia's testnet contracts to send messages between contracts across both chains.
