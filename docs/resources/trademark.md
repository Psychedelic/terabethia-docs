# Trademark

Fleek LLC originally conceived Terabethia and is in charge of distributing its open source code and interfaces. Terabethia is fully open source; however, this does not provide access to the Terabethia brand and image trademarks/licenses.

We take the usage of our brand and service trademarks very seriously, as it is our responsibility to ensure all Terabethia users whether Fleek LLC is the entity behind a service or website; and that the resources, platforms, services, and open source code/software that is shared represents unmodified Terabethia software.

These trademark policies affect the Terabethia brand, and associated image, logos, websites, and content.

- Use Terabethia's logos for the aforementioned uses, without modifying them other than in scale.
